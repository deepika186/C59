        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I would like to talk about how i love reading. 

            I had started reading comics right from the age of 6-7 years. My fav comic book was Tinkle which was a fortnightly. I also used to read other kids books like Gokulam, Champak etc. I start reading magazines as i grew older, although not very regularly. But soon when i was in high school, i started reading novels. My fav novels include series like The Famous Five, Nancy Drew etc. My fav author has always been Enid Blyton. I especially love the novels Hiedi and Malory towers.
